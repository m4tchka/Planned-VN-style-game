# Planned-VN-style-game
This repository will contain the planning and (hopefully eventually) the code for a game.


This aims to be a VN-style shoot'em'up top-down game reminiscent of browser flash games from the mid-late 2000s, and will combine gameplay similar to those, with VN style storytelling in between.

Planned features include:

    VN style UI for dialogue, with the usual buttons on/ near the dialogue box:
        Autoplay
        Hide
        Archive/log (of recent?/all past dialogue)
        Options
        Fastforward
        Save/Load
        Single-click to finish animation/s (of text &/or character cutouts)
        
    Basic character cutouts & animations (entries/exits/interludes) (requires: Learning how to draw (again))

    CLI tool for writing dialogue (>>> Exact format TBD <<<)
        (intended behaviour): 
            Typing a char name followed by a colon followed by more text and then pressing enter; 
               (ex. char1.char1surname: dialogue goes here!), 
            Returns: Char1 <br> "Dialogue goes here!".
