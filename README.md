# Planned-VN-style-game
This repository will contain the planning and (hopefully eventually) the code for a game.


This aims to be a VN-style shoot'em'up top-down game reminiscent of browser flash games from the mid-late 2000s.
  
Inspired by:
  Browser/Flash games:
    Starwish (god tier game)
    Decision 1/2
    Robokill 1/2
    Endless War 1-7
    Planet Noevo 1/2
    Medieval Rampage 1/2
   
   VNs:
    Baldr Sky 1/2
